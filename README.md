# @vx/demo

This is a fork of the
[demo repo](https://github.com/hshoff/vx/tree/master/packages/vx-demo).

* with the additional added functionality of the
[shownocode](https://github.com/stormasm/vx-demo/blob/bp1/components/shownocode.js)
concept
* instead of
[showcode](https://github.com/stormasm/vx-demo/blob/bp1/components/show.js)
which enables a dropdown of the code associated
with the demo.
